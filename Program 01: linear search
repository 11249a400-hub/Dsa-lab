Experiment 1
LINEAR SEARCH :

Aim:
To write a program to search for a given element in a list (or array) using the Linear Search technique.

Algorithm:
1.Start
2. Input the number of elements in the array.
3. Read all the elements of the array.
4. Input the element to be searched (key).
5. Set a flag variable (e.g., found = 0).
6. Repeat from index i = 0 to n - 1:
If array[i] == key, then
Set found = 1
7.Print “Element found at position i+1”
8.Stop the search.

CODE:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, key, found = 0;
    
    printf("Enter the size of array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
  int A[n]
    
    printf("Enter./.d the elements of the array: ");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    
    printf("Enter the element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] == key) {
            printf("Element found at position %d\n", i + 1);
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (!found) {
        printf("Element not found in the array.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}

INPUT:
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter elements: 10 20 30 40 50
Enter element to search: 30

OUTPUT:
Element found at position 3

RESULT:
Thus, the program to search for a given element using the Linear Search technique was successfully executed and verified.
