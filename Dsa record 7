experiment 7
ENQUE operation:

AIM:

To study and implement the enqueue operation in a queue data structure using an array, where an element is inserted at the rear end of the queue.


ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Check if rear == MAX-1
  • If TRUE → Queue is FULL → Overflow
  • If FALSE → Continue
Step 3: If front == -1, set front = 0
Step 4: Increment rear = rear + 1
Step 5: Insert the element at queue[rear]
Step 6: Stop


---


CODE:


#include <stdio.h>
#define size 5

int queue[size];
int front = -1;
int rear = -1;

void enqueue(int val) {
    if (rear == size - 1) {
        printf("Queue is full, cannot insert\\n");
    } else {
        if (front == -1)
            front = 0;
        rear++;
        queue[rear] = val;
        printf("%d inserted into queue\\n", val);
    }
}

int main() {
    enqueue(10);
    enqueue(20);
    enqueue(30);
    enqueue(40);
    enqueue(8);
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:

10 inserted into queue
20 inserted into queue
30 inserted into queue
40 inserted into queue
8 inserted into queue

RESULT :

The enqueue operation was successfully implemented using an array.
Elements were inserted at the rear end of the queue and the contents of the queue were displayed correctly.
