EXPERIMENT:2
Binary search:


AIM:
To write a program to search for a given element in an array using the Binary Search technique.

ALGORITHM:
1. Start the program.
2. Initialize an array of sorted elements.
3. Read the number of elements, n.
4. Read the n sorted elements into the array.
5. Read the element to be searched, say key.
6. Initialize two variables:
low = 0
high = n - 1
7. Repeat the following steps while low <= high:
Find the middle index: mid = (low + high) // 2
If array[mid] == key, then
Print “Element found at position mid + 1”
Stop the search.
Else if array[mid] > key, the,
Set high = mid - 1,
Else
Set low = mid + 1.
8. If the element is not found, print “Element not found”.
9. Stop the program.

CODE:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};
    int n = sizeof(A) / sizeof(A[0]);
    int low = 0;
    int high = n - 1;
    int key;
    int found = 0;

    printf("Enter the element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (A[mid] == key) {
            printf("Element found at position: %d\n", mid + 1);
            found = 1;
            break;
        } else if (A[mid] < key) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    if (!found) {
        printf("Element not found in the array.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

INPUT:
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter sorted elements: 10 20 30 40 50
Enter element to search: 40

OUTPUT:
Element not found 

RESULT:
Thus, the program to search for a given element using the Binary Search technique was successfully executed and verified.
